# Udemy-Web-Dev-Course

Repository in which I document my progress in an online course on Udemy.com
the course is teaching me HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and jQuery.

I am completing this course to further my knowledge in front end developing
technologies. It is a tutorial style based course in which I'm being tought 
all the technologies I mentioned above work together in creating a desired 
product. The course is estimated at 40hr. For every conept that is explaned,
im trying to dive in deeper by researching them more in depth.
