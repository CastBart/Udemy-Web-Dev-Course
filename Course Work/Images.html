                <h3>About me.</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm originaly from Poland born in 1997. When I was 7 years old, my fathered moved to Ireland in hopes of finging a job so the rest of my family could move there.
                    When I was 8, couple days after my comunion my mother, sisters and I flew over to Ireland to join my father. In ireland I finished primary and secondary school
                    in a town called Borris which is situated in the south-east of Ireland. I then went to college in Carlow IT to study Computer Games Development. It was a 4 year
                    course but unfortunately due to lack of money I only completed 3 years of the course getting a Distinction. Now my girlfriend and I just moved to Italy in hopes
                    of findidng future here. Im currently self educating and bringing back everything I learned about coding. Im doing this so I can find a job in the field that I
                    studied in.

                <h3>Apartment.</h3>
                <p>
                    The apartment that my girlfriend Ciara and I are currently living in is absolutley amazing. We didn't expect it to be so nice. The pictures online dont do it
                    justice. It has a large bedroom with a king sized bed, two bed stands, a cupboard and wardrobe. Then there is the living room which has a pull-out sofa bed,
                    with a TV and few shelves hung on the walls. This leads into a kitchen with a small dining table and everything a kitchen could have except an oven :( There is
                    also a bathroom with a shower.

                <h3>City.</h3>
                <p>
                    The city that we are staying in is La Spezia. It is a costal city and we have about 20 minute walk to the port. The food over here is amazing, you can eat all
                    pizza and pasta you can imagine.
